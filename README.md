# ðŸ§  Simple CPU Design with Verilog on Xilinx Vivado

This repository contains a basic CPU model designed using **Verilog HDL** and implemented on **FPGA** using **Xilinx Vivado**. The project was originally developed as part of a university course on computer architecture or digital logic design.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This CPU is a simple single-cycle processor capable of executing a custom instruction set. The main objective of the project was to gain hands-on experience with:

- Digital system design
- Hardware Description Languages (Verilog)
- FPGA implementation and simulation using Xilinx Vivado

## ðŸ§© Features

- âœ… 32-bit instruction support 
- âœ… Arithmetic & logic operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, etc.)
- âœ… Register File
- âœ… Control Unit (FSM-based)
- âœ… Instruction Memory
- âœ… Program Counter (PC)
- âœ… Simulation Testbenches
